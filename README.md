Engine
------

The engine is a **diesel** engine. The great advantage of diesel engine over 
other engine is that it only requires electric spark upon starting the engine. 
Therefore it does not consume any electricity thereafter. 

The engine on a vessel is very similar to a car engine, the main difference is 
that the cooling system relies on the sea water rather than the airflow produced
from the speed of the car. 

The engine can be divided into 3 parts:
* The cooling system 
* The fuel system 
* The gearing system 

**The cooling system** 

The engine needs to be continuously cooled in order to function properly. It
can run Ok for a short amount of time but rapidly need cooling. 

##### Fresh cooling water 

The engine is cooled with a cooling water circuit. This is fresh water with 
optionally some anti-freezing product. This is similar to a car engine. The 
cooling water goes through all the major part of the engine and the heat is 
transfered to it. The fresh cooling water needs to be filled up from time to 
time and checking its level is part of the daily maintainance. 

Note that the fresh water can also be connected to the hot water tank and used 
to heat the water. The fresh cooling water usually reaches 70C.

The fresh water cooling system goes through the following engine/boat part:
* `heat exchanger `
* `thermostat`
* `fresh water pump `
* `hot water tank `
* around the various part of the engine which requires to be cooled 
* back to the heat exchanger

##### Raw cooling water 

Eventually the fresh water needs to be cooled as well. Raw water (ie the water
the vessel is sailing on) is used for that purpose. It is continuously pumped 
through a **heat exchanger**, in which the heat is being transferred to it from 
the fresh cooling water, and then expelled through the engine exhaust. 

The heat exchanger plays the same role as the radiator in a car. 

The raw water cooling system goeth through the following part of the 
engine/boat:

* `hole in the hull` (maybe there is a better name) 
* `rubber pipe`
* `through hole with valve`: this is the first thing you can see and have access
  to from the boat cabin. The valve is used to stop any water from coming in.
  In most cases it should remains open. 
* `strainer` used to filter out particles/small fish/shell/debris...
* `pump`
* `solid pipe` around the engine 
* `heat exchanger` (see above fo the explanation) 
* `ventilator loop` used to separate the air from the water 
* `exhaust meling elbow` where the water plastic pipe meets with the engine 
   exhaust. The water is then expelled by the same hole as the exhaust gaz 
   from the engine.

**Daily Maintenance**

* Check the fresh cooling water level
* Check that the raw water valve is open
* Check the raw water strainer and remove particles
